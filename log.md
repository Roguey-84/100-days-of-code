# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've read a lesson about JavaScript operators and finished 2 tasks, that it offered.

**Thoughts** JavaScript is a very difficult language for me, so I think it will be a very long story.

### Day 1: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've learned a lot about colors and gradients in CSS on freeCodeCamp. I never knew, that you could make stripes with the help of repeating-linear-gradient().

**Thoughts** That was a very fascinating and interesting lesson. I hope tomorrow will be even more interesting day.

### Day 8: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I've learned a lot about CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.

### Day 9: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I have finally ended all the CSS Grid challenges on freeCodeCamp and started working on a project making a Survey Form. 

**Thoughts** I couldn't come up with my own form, so I just copied the form from the example. I just had to come up with my own design in CSS.

### Day 39: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today a worked with Boolean data type, comparison operators and if/else and switch statements on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** I like how easily a created mini-games with the help of JavaScript, especially counting cards for Blackjack. I think I'm a gambler.

### Day 40: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked with objects on freeCodeCamp and created a function which modifies JSON Record Collection. 

**Thoughts** It wasn't easy, but I found a solution and it works. I have a feeling that I can do more and I actually want more. I start liking JavaScript.

### Day 41: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked with the loops and created a function which should check if the given array with profiles had a name and a property given in arguments. 

**Thoughts** It is a shame, but I had to look at a hint. One small mistake prevented me from solving the problem.

### Day 42: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic JavaScript is finally over, now I'm going through ES6 challenges on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** It is actually very interesting and I'm starting to learn something new. For exapmle, I didn't know about the Object.freeze() functon.

### Day 43: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continue learning new features of ECMAScript 6.  

**Thoughts** Arrow functions created a little obstacle for me, but I overcame it to learn more about rest and spread operators.

### Day 44: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I missed three day due to my lack of concentration. But today I brought myself to the computer and learned about destructing assignment and template literals.  

**Thoughts** That is all very interesting, but I still don't know how to put it into practice and that disappoints me.

--------------------------------------------------------
### Day 45: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed all the ES6 Challenges on freeCodeCamp.  

**Thoughts** It is too bad that there were no practice exercises, where I could think and learn how to use all this new features.

### Day 46: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to work with the real project, so completed a Task List from Brad Traversy's lessons.  

**Thoughts** Not sure if I understood all the manipulations, but I'll try to remake it without watching the video of the lesson.

### Day 47: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to remake the code for the Task List, which I made yesterday.  

**Thoughts** I had some trouble with the Local Storage, but in the end I actually made it. That is such a great feeling!

--------------------------------------------------------
### Day 48: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on a Loan Calculator from Brad Traversy'lessons.  

**Thoughts** It is quite simple, especially after making a Task List. All the manipulations were almost the same, except for the setTimeout() function, which was new and very useful for making a loading circle.
