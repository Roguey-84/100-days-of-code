# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've read a lesson about JavaScript operators and finished 2 tasks, that it offered.

**Thoughts** JavaScript is a very difficult language for me, so I think it will be a very long story.

### Day 1: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've learned a lot about colors and gradients in CSS on freeCodeCamp. I never knew, that you could make stripes with the help of repeating-linear-gradient().

**Thoughts** That was a very fascinating and interesting lesson. I hope tomorrow will be even more interesting day.

### Day 2: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've completed all the tasks about Visual design and started learing about Accessability.

**Thoughts** CSS is so interesting. I even forgot about the time and didn't notice that the day had already come to an end.
