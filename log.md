# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've read a lesson about JavaScript operators and finished 2 tasks, that it offered.

**Thoughts** JavaScript is a very difficult language for me, so I think it will be a very long story.

### Day 1: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've learned a lot about colors and gradients in CSS on freeCodeCamp. I never knew, that you could make stripes with the help of repeating-linear-gradient().

**Thoughts** That was a very fascinating and interesting lesson. I hope tomorrow will be even more interesting day.

**Today's Progress**: Today I've learned a lot about CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.

**Today's Progress**: Today I have finally ended all the CSS Grid challenges on freeCodeCamp and started working on a project making a Survey Form. 

**Thoughts** I couldn't come up with my own form, so I just copied the form from the example. I just had to come up with my own design in CSS.
